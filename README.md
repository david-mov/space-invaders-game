## About

Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with lasers by moving it horizontally
across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The player defeats an alien,
and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement speed up. The aim is to defeat as many aliens as you can and accumulate as many points as possible.

The aliens attempt to destroy the ship by colliding with it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom,
the alien invasion is successful and the game ends.
